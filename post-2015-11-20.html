Featuring speakers from a variety of disciplines who are distinguished for their exceptional research and advocacy, this event promises to be an invigorating amalgamation of knowledge-sharing and discussion. It will highlight some of the many advances that have been made, while also emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts to continue making progress in our work surrounding HIV/AIDS. In addition to our guest speakers, there will be musical and artistic performances as well as a NGO fair that will feature an array of campus groups and community organizations who have made staggering contributions to HIV/AIDS efforts at both a local and global level. This event is entirely FREE, though optional donations will be accepted, with all proceeds going to the Teresa Group, a clinic specializing in frontline services to support the wellbeing of children affected with HIV/AIDS and their families.</p><div class="links-black"><a> <i class="fa fa-arrow-left fa-1x"></i> Go back to all posts</a></div></div></div><div class="contact"><div class="contact-left"><h2>
